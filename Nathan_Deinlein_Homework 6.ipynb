I found it interesting with both searches that there were not many similar matches. To my knowledge this is a fairly well read book. I'm actually about to start being in a book group that is reading this right now. So the fact that there were not more versions of the book or books similar was surprising to me. I think had I selected a fiction book that the algorithm probably would have come up with more results for both. However, with the google search there seemed to be a lot more relevent data than with the amazon search. Yet again, strange, because this was a book we were searching for in the first place."
